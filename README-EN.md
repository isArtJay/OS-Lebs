# Origins

In our junior year, we offered a professional course on operating system principles, mainly focusing on basic theory. Because I want to study this course in depth, I read **HaGongDa's "Operating System" open course by Mr. Li Zhijun**and **BeiDa's "Operating System Principles" basic course by Mr. Chen Xiangqun** at the same time with **Tang Xiaodan's "Computer Operating System (4th Edition) "** as the tutorial material. This will ensure a very solid basic knowledge.

Once you've learned the theory, you have to have practice. I was thinking: "there are some simple experiments can let me learn the theoretical knowledge before the series, practice and apply it", and then I think with this many times Google, Baidu, head into the sea of search engines, all kinds of Link dominated my mouse, in the end is not! And the end.

By chance, I posted a topic on V2EX: [Are there any good experimental exercises on operating systems?](https://www.v2ex.com/t/725015) This topic was clicked more than 600 times and liked by more than 20 people within 2 hours. Finally, in the comments section of the topic, I saw that people shared their experimental projects about operating systems, including ucore from Tsinghua University, Nanjing University, Stanford, and even the master course 6.828, which made me very happy and proved the saying "If you want to learn, there is something to learn".

This repository was born here, to help little white guys like me to feel the charm of OS by organizing some OS **fundamental theory courses** and **excellent experimental projects**. In the meantime, my experiments will be documented here.
